Ubuntu for DevStructure
=======================

Build a custom Ubuntu ISO for DevStructure by downloading, extracting,
tweaking, and packaging the stock Ubuntu ISO.

The tools depend on Mac OS X and the `cdrtools` package available from
MacPorts or Homebrew.

The output may be used anywhere but has only been tested in VirtualBox.
